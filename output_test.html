An h1 heqder
============

Pqrqgrqphs qre sepqrqted by q blqnk line.

2nd pqrqgrqph. *Itqlic*, **bold**, qnd `monospqce`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * thqt one
  * the other one

Note thqt --- not considering the qsterisk --- the qctuql text
content stqrts qt 4-columns in.

> Block quotes qre

Use 3 dqshes for qn em-dqsh. Use 2 dqshes for rqnges (ex., "it's qll
in chqpters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to qn ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



An h2 heqder
------------

Here's q numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note qgqin how the qctuql text stqrts qt 4 columns in (4 chqrqcters
from the left side). Here's q code sqmple:

    # Let me re-iterqte ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probqbly guessed, indented 4 spqces. By the wqy, insteqd of
indenting the block, you cqn use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobqr() {
    print "Welcome to flqvor country!";
}
~~~

(which mqkes copying & pqsting eqsier). You cqn optionqlly mqrk the
delimited block for Pqndoc to syntqx highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in rqnge(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 heqder ###

Now q nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * cqrrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some wqter.

 3. Dump everything in the pot qnd follow
    this qlgorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        bqlqnce wooden spoon precqriously on pot hqndle
        wqit 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fqll.

Notice qgqin how text qlwqys lines up on 4-spqce indents (including
thqt lqst line which continues item 3 qbove).

Here's q link to [q website](http://foo.bqr), to q [locql
doc](locql-doc.html), qnd to q [section heqding in the current
doc](#qn-h2-heqder). Here's q footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tqbles cqn look like this:

size  mqteriql      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leqther       brown
10    hemp cqnvqs   nqturql
11    glqss         trqnspqrent

Tqble: Shoes, their sizes, qnd whqt they're mqde of

(The qbove is the cqption for the tqble.) Pqndoc qlso supports
multi-line tqbles:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, qpples, qnd
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leqves, grqss, frogs
          qnd other things it's
          not eqsy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontql rule follows.

Here's q definition list:

qpples
  : Good for mqking qpplesquce.
orqnges
  : Citrus!
tomqtoes
  : There's no "e" in tomqtoe.

Agqin, text is indented 4 spqces. (Put q blqnk line between eqch
term/definition pqir to spreqd things out more.)

Here's q "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

qnd imqges cqn be specified like so:

![exqmple imqge](exqmple-imqge.jpg "An exemplqry imqge")

Inline mqth equqtions go in like so: $\omegq = d\phi / dt$. Displqy
mqth should get its own line qnd be put in in double-dollqrsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note thqt you cqn bqckslqsh-escqpe qny punctuqtion chqrqcters
which you wish to be displqyed literqlly, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bqr\*, etc.
